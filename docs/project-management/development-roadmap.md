    *   **Story:** As a driver, I want to be able to log in to the driver app to see my assignments.
    *   **Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a minimal API endpoint for user registration and login, connected to Supabase Auth.

*   **Epic: Order Placement (Customer App)**
    *   **Story:** As a customer, I want to view a list of available stores and their products.
    *   **Story:** As a customer, I want to add products to a shopping cart and place an order.
    *   **Story:** As a developer, I want to create an API endpoint to receive and store new orders in the database.

*   **Epic: Order Management (Store Dashboard)**
    *   **Story:** As a store manager, I want to view a list of incoming orders.
    *   **Story:** As a store manager, I want to be able to accept or reject an order.
    *   **Story:** As a developer, I want to create an API endpoint to allow stores to update the status of an order.

*   **Epic: Task Management (Driver App)**
    *   **Story:** As a driver, I want to see a list of available orders that need a driver.
    *   **Story:** As a driver, I want to be able to accept an order to begin the delivery process.
    *   **Story:** As a developer, I want to create an API endpoint to assign a driver to an order.

## Phase 2: Essential Features & Testing (3-5 weeks)

**Goal:** Build out the remaining essential features for the MVP, including real-time tracking and notifications, and establish a solid testing foundation.

*   **Epic: Live Order Tracking**
    *   **Story:** As a customer, I want to see the real-time location of the driver on a map.
    *   **Story:** As a driver, I want my location to be shared with the customer and the system while I'm on a delivery.
    *   **Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Leaflet and OpenStreetMap to display driver locations.
    *   **Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a mechanism (e.g., Supabase Realtime) to push location updates to the customer app.

*   **Epic: Notifications**
    *   **Story:** As a customer, I want to receive push notifications when my order status changes.
    *   **Story:** As a driver, I want to receive a notification when a new order is available.
    *   **Story:** As a store manager, I want to be notified when a new order is placed.
    *   **Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate a notification service (e.g., OneSignal) and trigger notifications at key points in the order lifecycle.

*   **Epic: Quality Assurance**
    *   **Story:** As a developer, I want to write unit tests for critical business logic in the Meta-Orchestrator.
    *   **Story:** As a developer, I want to write integration tests for the core API endpoints.
    *   **Story:** As a QA tester, I want to perform basic end-to-end testing of the primary user flows.

## Phase 3: Pilot & Refinement (2-3 weeks)

**Goal:** Deploy the MVP to a controlled group of users, gather feedback, and make necessary refinements before a wider launch.

*   **Epic: Pilot Deployment**
    *   **Story:** As an administrator, I want to deploy the platform to a staging or pilot environment.
    *   **Story:** As a developer, I want to create a process for onboarding pilot users (customers, drivers, and stores).

*   **Epic: Feedback & Iteration**
    *   **Story:** As a project manager, I want to collect and analyze feedback from pilot users to identify bugs and areas for improvement.
    *   **Story:** As a developer, I want to prioritize and fix critical bugs reported during the pilot phase.
    *   **Story:** As a UX designer, I want to refine the UI based on user feedback to improve usability.
