# Project Charter: Smart Delivery Platform

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Smart Delivery Platform (SDP)

**Vision:** To create an integrated, enterprise-grade ecosystem that connects customers, drivers, and stores in a seamless, real-time environment.

**Mission:** To empower businesses with a robust, scalable, and efficient platform that enhances the delivery experience for all stakeholders through modern technology and best practices.

## 2. Project Objectives

The primary objective is to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Smart Delivery Platform with the following core goals:

*   **Functional Core:** Deliver a platform with essential features for customers, drivers, and store managers.
*   **Accelerated Development:** Leverage open-source templates and cost-effective resources to minimize time-to-market.
*   **Scalable Foundation:** Build a maintainable and scalable codebase that can evolve to meet future demands.
*   **User-Centric Design:** Provide a superior and intuitive user experience for all user roles.

## 3. Scope

### In-Scope for MVP:

*   **Customer App:**
    *   User registration and authentication.
    *   Browsing stores and products.
    *   Placing orders.
    *   Basic order tracking.
*   **Driver App:**
    *   Viewing and accepting available orders.
    *   Route information via map integration.
    *   Updating order status.
*   **Store Dashboard:**
    *   Managing store profile and products.
    *   Viewing and managing incoming orders.
*   **Core Backend:**
    *   API for core user flows.
    *   Database management via Supabase.
    *   Basic notification system.

### Out-of-Scope for MVP:

*   Advanced features like user-to-user chat, gifting, and intelligent recommendations.
*   Complex analytics and reporting dashboards.
*   Marketing and promotional campaign management tools.
*   Advanced security features beyond core authentication and data protection.
*   Full-scale payment integration (focus on cash-on-delivery or simple online payment).

## 4. Key Stakeholders

| Stakeholder Group      | Description                                      | Key Interests                                     |

| **Customers**          | End-users ordering products.                     | Ease of use, reliability, real-time tracking.     |
| **Drivers**            | Individuals delivering orders.                   | Clear instructions, efficient routing, fair pay.  |
| **Store Owners/Managers** | Businesses selling products on the platform.   | Easy order management, inventory control, sales data. |
| **Platform Administrators** | Team responsible for managing the system.      | System stability, user management, support tools. |
| **Development Team**   | Engineers building and maintaining the platform. | Clear requirements, stable architecture, quality code. |

## 5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

The success of the Smart Delivery Platform will be measured against the following key performance indicators:

### Business & Operational Metrics:
*   **Order Completion Rate:** Percentage of orders successfully delivered.
*   **Average Delivery Time:** Time from order placement to delivery.
*   **User Adoption Rate:** Number of active customers, drivers, and stores.
*   **User Satisfaction (CSAT/NPS):** Feedback scores from all user groups.

### Technical & System Health Metrics:
*   **Service Availability (Uptime):** Percentage of time the platform is operational.
*   **API Response Time:** 95th and 99th percentile response times for critical endpoints.
*   **Error Rate:** Percentage of failed requests or operations.
*   **Lead Time for Changes:** Time from code commit to production deployment.

## 6. Assumptions & Constraints

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Open-source templates will provide a significant head start on UI development.
    *   Supabase and serverless functions will be sufficient for MVP backend needs.
*   **Constraints:**
    *   The project will adhere to the technology stack defined in `docs/specifications/tech-stack.md`.
    -   The initial development will focus strictly on the defined MVP scope to manage timelines and resources effectively.
