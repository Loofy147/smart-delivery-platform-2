# Project Plan: Smart Delivery Platform MVP

**Goals:**

*   Develop a functional delivery platform MVP with core features for customers, drivers, and store managers.
*   Leverage open-source templates and free/low-cost resources to minimize development time and expenses.
*   Build a scalable and maintainable codebase.

**Phases:**

1.  **Phase 0: Ultra-Lean Setup & Template Integration (2-4 weeks)**
    *   **Deliverables:**
        *   Chosen and evaluated open-source templates for customer app, driver app, and admin dashboard.
        *   Detailed component extraction plans for each chosen template.
        *   Initial monorepo project setup with core packages and tools.
        *   Preliminary database schema design.
        *   Updated project documentation (tech stack, decisions, tasks).

2.  **Phase 1: Core Implementation & Minimal API (4-6 weeks)**
    *   **Deliverables:**
        *   Customized UI components and layouts based on chosen templates.
        *   Minimal API implemented with serverless functions, connected to Supabase.
        *   Basic functionality for core user flows (order placement, driver task management, product management).

3.  **Phase 2: Essential Features & Testing (3-5 weeks)**
    *   **Deliverables:**
        *   Implementation of remaining essential features (e.g., map integration, order tracking, notifications).
        *   Unit, integration, and basic end-to-end tests.

4.  **Phase 3: Pilot & Refinement (2-3 weeks)**
    *   **Deliverables:**
        *   Pilot testing with internal users or beta testers.
        *   Feedback collection and analysis.
        *   Bug fixes and refinements.

5.  **Subsequent Phases (TBD):**
        *   Feature expansion, performance optimization, security hardening, marketing & launch.

**Note:** Timelines are estimates and may be adjusted based on team availability and project progress.
