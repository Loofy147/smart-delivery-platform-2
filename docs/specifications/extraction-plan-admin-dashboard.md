# Extraction Plan: Admin Dashboard (React Admin Dashboard by Devias IO)

**Template:** React Admin Dashboard by Devias IO ([https://github.com/devias-io/material-kit-react](https://github.com/devias-io/material-kit-react))

**Goal:** Extract and adapt key components to build the admin dashboard interface for our delivery platform MVP.

## Key Components

*   **Dashboard Layout:** Provides the overall structure and navigation for the admin interface.
*   **Data Tables:** Display data for users, stores, products, and orders in a tabular format.
*   **Form Components:** Allow administrators to create, edit, and delete data (e.g., products, store information).
*   **Authentication Components:** Handle admin login and access control.
*   **Navigation Menu:** Enables navigation between different sections of the dashboard.

## Extraction Steps

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Obtain the template (likely by downloading or cloning).
    *   Explore the project structure to understand how components, pages, and data management are organized.

2.  **Component Identification:**
    *   Locate the key components within the template. Focus on directories related to:
        *   `src/layouts/`: For the main dashboard layout.
        *   `src/views/`: For different views or sections of the dashboard (e.g., user management, product management).
        *   `src/components/`: For reusable UI components.
        *   `src/pages/`: For authentication pages (e.g., login).

3.  **Dependency Analysis:**
    *   Identify the template's dependencies, paying attention to:
        *   UI component library: This template uses Material UI, which we should leverage.
        *   Routing library: Likely React Router.
        *   Data fetching or state management solutions (if any).
        *   Authentication-related libraries.

4.  **Extraction & Refactoring:**
    *   Copy the relevant components into our `apps/admin` project (or potentially `packages/ui` for shared components), organizing them appropriately.
    *   Refactor the code to:
        *   Remove placeholder data and integrate with our Supabase API. This will involve:
            *   Creating API functions to interact with Supabase.
            *   Adapting the components to use these new functions for data display and manipulation.
        *   Adapt styling as needed, primarily using Material UI's theming capabilities to maintain consistency.
        *   Adjust routing and navigation to fit our admin interface structure.
        *   Ensure components are well-documented and reusable.
        *   Remove any unnecessary features or sections not required for our MVP.

5.  **Authentication Integration:**
    *   Carefully integrate the template's authentication flow with our Supabase authentication. This might involve:
        *   Adapting the login component to use Supabase's authentication methods.
        *   Protecting routes based on user roles and permissions (if needed for the MVP).

6.  **Testing:**
    *   Implement component tests, focusing on:
        *   Data rendering in tables and forms.
        *   Form submission and data validation.
        *   Navigation and routing logic.
        *   Authentication flow.

## Potential Challenges

*   **Material UI Integration:** While we can leverage Material UI, we need to ensure our customizations and any additional styling are consistent with the template's overall design.
*   **Data Model Adaptation:** Adapting the data table and form components to work seamlessly with our specific data models (users, stores, products, orders) will require careful attention.
*   **Authentication Flow:** Integrating Supabase authentication might require significant changes to the template's existing authentication components and routing logic.
*   **Authorization (Optional):** If we need to implement role-based access control (e.g., restricting certain actions to admin users), this will add complexity to the authentication and routing integration.
