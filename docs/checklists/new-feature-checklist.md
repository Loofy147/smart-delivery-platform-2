# New Feature Development Checklist

This checklist provides a comprehensive guide for developing and launching new features on the Smart Delivery Platform. Following these steps ensures that all aspects of the development lifecycle, from planning to release, are covered.

---

### Phase 1: Planning & Design

-   [ ] **Define the "Why":** Clearly articulate the problem this feature solves and the value it brings to users.
-   [ ] **Gather Requirements:** Create a detailed list of functional and non-functional requirements.
-   [ ] **Create User Stories:** Break down the feature into actionable user stories, following the format: "As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]."
-   [ ] **Design UI/UX Mockups:** Develop wireframes or high-fidelity mockups for any new user interfaces.
-   [ ] **Architectural Review:**
    -   [ ] Discuss the feature with the team to determine its impact on the existing system architecture.
    -   [ ] Create or update an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) if the feature introduces significant architectural changes.
-   [ ] **Data Modeling:** Update the database schema if new data models are required.
-   [ ] **Define Success Metrics:** Determine how the success and impact of the feature will be measured (e.g., adoption rate, user satisfaction, performance improvements).

### Phase 2: Development

-   [ ] **Create a Feature Branch:** Create a new git branch from the `develop` branch, following the naming convention `feature/<ticket-number>-<short-description>`.
-   [ ] **Implement the Feature:** Write the code for the feature, adhering to the project's coding standards.
-   [ ] **Write Unit & Integration Tests:**
    -   [ ] Add unit tests for new functions and business logic, ensuring adequate code coverage.
    -   [ ] Add integration tests for new API endpoints or component interactions.
-   [ ] **Update Documentation:**
    -   [ ] Update the `system-architecture.md` if the feature alters the architecture.
    -   [ ] Add or update API documentation for any new or modified endpoints.
    -   [ ] Update user guides or other relevant documentation.
-   [ ] **Manual Testing:** Perform thorough manual testing in a local development environment to ensure the feature works as expected.

### Phase 3: Review & QA

-   [ ] **Code Review:**
    -   [ ] Open a pull request (PR) targeting the `develop` branch.
    -   [ ] Ensure the PR description is clear and links to the relevant user stories or tickets.
    -   [ ] Complete the [Code Review Checklist](./code-review-checklist.md).
    -   [ ] Obtain at least one approval from another developer.
-   [ ] **QA Testing:**
    -   [ ] Merge the feature branch into the `develop` branch and deploy to a staging environment.
    -   [ ] Conduct formal QA testing in the staging environment, checking for bugs, usability issues, and requirement gaps.
    -   [ ] Perform regression testing to ensure the new feature has not broken existing functionality.

---

### Phase 4: Release

-   [ ] **Merge to Main:** Once QA is complete, merge the `develop` branch into the `main` branch.
-   [ ] **Pre-Deployment Check:**
    -   [ ] Complete the [Pre-Deployment Checklist](./pre-deployment-checklist.md).
    -   [ ] Announce the upcoming release to the team and stakeholders.
-   [ ] **Deploy to Production:** Deploy the new feature to the production environment.
-   [ ] **Post-Release Monitoring:**
    -   [ ] Monitor system health, error rates, and performance metrics to ensure the release is stable.
    -   [ ] Track the success metrics defined in the planning phase.
-   [ ] **Close Tickets:** Close all related user stories and tickets.
-   [ ] **Celebrate!** ðŸŽ‰
